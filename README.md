# Bayer-Digital-Label-Hackathon

This project involves the implementation of a one-stop solution for all of the farmer's needs. Some of the major problems addressed include the creation of a unique digital identity, enabling a dynamic label that can be used to view detailed information about the product, supply chain visibility, product authenticity, customer support, ease of shopping experience. 

Our proposed solution basically involves the implementation of 
- A One-Stop Application aiming to improve the farmerâ€™s experience throughout. 
 - A single digital identity for each Bayer product to facilitate supply chain visibility and tracking powered by blockchain technology. 
- A single customized platform/application to purchase/manage all products bought by the Bayer customer.
- Integrated Support Feature with the ability to submit complaints in the form of text/multimedia regarding their problems
- SmartScan Feature that helps diagnose plant diseases which could later be integrated to recommend the right products. 

Our application's key features include the following:
- Dashboard Page
- Blockchain-based supply chain tracking and authenticity checks. 
- Bayer Store with integrated cart and Stripe payment gateway
- Customer Support Page 
- Product Authenticity Page
- Built-in recommendation system to identify frequently bought-together items.
- SmartScan Feature to identify disease from the image of the plant

Each part of the application has been explained detailed in the PowerPoint presentation and the demo video.
